1. Approximate query matching (potentially use soundex and/or expose
another search URL)

2. Show upper bound on time saved if input file were sorted (in case
of unsorted input file)

3. Vulnerable to long bodies being sent by attacker. Does not cause
memory blow-up but causes data to be continuously read. There is
nothing we can do about it since the attacker could very well just
create many connections and do the same thing even if we limit the #
of bytes received on a single connection. Let me know if there is a
better way to handle this.
